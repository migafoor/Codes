//There are some ways to achieve this. First one is by $elemMatch operator:

const docs = await Documents.find({category: { $elemMatch: {$eq: 'yourCategory'} }});
// you may need to convert 'yourCategory' to ObjectId

//Second one is by $in or $all operators:

const docs = await Documents.find({category: { $in: [yourCategory] }});

or

const docs = await Documents.find({category: { $all: [yourCategory] }});
// you can give more categories with these two approaches 
//and again you may need to convert yourCategory to ObjectId

$in is like OR and $all like AND


Third one is by aggregate() function:

const docs = await Documents.aggregate([
    { $unwind: '$category' },
    { $match: { 'category': mongoose.Types.ObjectId(yourCategory) } }
]};

with aggregate() you get only one category id in your category array.
